# :wave: My opinion

## :octocat: What would you like to see more of? 

At the moment I would say that of everything, what I have seen so far I have loved and the only thing I want for now is to learn more about what this course has to offer, although if I had to be more specific I would say to learn more about githu

## :octocat: What would be interesting or helpful to your learning journey?

I think it is to learn the theory and science behind this programming or technology, since by learning how it works and understanding it, we would have a perspective capable of helping us when choosing what we want to focus on after finishing university.
